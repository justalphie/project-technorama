This presentation delves into how Generative AI and multi-agent systems, particularly utilizing AutoGen, can significantly enhance a developer\u2019s workflow, particularly in creating, testing, and deploying code automatically.\n\nWe explore how GenAI multi-agent systems are not just tools but active participants in the coding process. These agents converse and collaborate with each other, each with a specific role, such as developer, QA engineer, or IT engineer. They generate code, review it, build it, test it, and deploy it, effectively becoming an integral part of the DevOps team.\n\nFor instance, consider a scenario where data needs to be extracted from one schema, transformed and loaded to another one. The GenAI multi-agents, using the available business descriptions and data schema, could autonomously create and deploy an ETL pipeline to extract data from the source, transform it according to the requirements, and load it into the target database. Then it is reviewed by the developer and if accepted move to production.\n\nBy automating repetitive, boilerplate and uninteresting tasks, GenAI multi-agents act as a second pair of hands, freeing developers to focus on more intellectually stimulating challenges.\n\nJoin us as we journey into the future of software development, where GenAI and human ingenuity intersect to redefine what\u2019s possible.
